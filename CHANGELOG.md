## Unreleased

### Changed

- Refactor: JSON Schema parsing and CLI boundaries now use fluent builder objects internally and call `.text()` at the top-level output boundary.
- CLI output is normalized with a trailing newline for stable file/stdout diffs.

### Fixed

- Test reliability: CLI tests no longer assume a globally available `tsx` binary.

### Added

- New fluent builder types for schema composition and primitives (e.g., union/intersection/tuple/record/any/never/unknown/literal).
