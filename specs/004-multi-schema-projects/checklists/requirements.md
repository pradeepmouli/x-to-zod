# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Schema Projects

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-07  
**Feature**: [004-multi-schema-projects/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 4 user stories clearly prioritized (1 P1, 1 P2, 2 P3)
- 15 functional requirements defined with clear testability
- 10 measurable success criteria established
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope items documented
- Spec uses business/user language, avoiding technical implementation details (TypeScript, Zod versions, etc. are mentioned only in context of constraints, not implementation approach)
