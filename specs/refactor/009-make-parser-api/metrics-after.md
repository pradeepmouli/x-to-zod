# Post-Refactoring Metrics (After Refactoring)

**Status**: Not yet captured

Run the following command to capture post-refactoring metrics:

```bash
.specify/extensions/workflows/refactor/measure-metrics.sh --after --dir "$REFACTOR_DIR"
```

This should be done AFTER refactoring is complete and all tests pass.
