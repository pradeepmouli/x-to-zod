# Refactor Spec: Apply fluent paradigms to make ZodBuilder surface more like Zod

**Refactor ID**: refactor-003
**Branch**: `refactor/003-apply-fluent-paradigms`
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Type**: [ ] Performance | [x] Maintainability | [ ] Security | [x] Architecture | [x] Tech Debt
**Impact**: [ ] High Risk | [x] Medium Risk | [ ] Low Risk
**Status**: [x] Planning | [ ] Baseline Captured | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Validation | [ ] Complete

## Input
User description: "apply fluent paradigms to make the ZodBuilder surface more like Zod. e.g.  build.number() maps to z.number() and returns a wrapper for the source text + methods like .int(), .optional(), .max() which would function like applyInt(), applyOptional(), applyMax() did."

## Motivation

### Current State Problems
**Code Smell(s)**:
- [x] Tight Coupling (procedural `apply*` modifiers scattered across builder/parsers)
- [x] Long Method (accumulating string transformations in imperative flows)
- [x] Primitive Obsession (manipulating source text strings directly rather than cohesive abstractions)
- [ ] Duplication (DRY violation)
- [ ] God Object/Class (too many responsibilities)
- [ ] Feature Envy
- [ ] Dead Code
- [ ] Magic Numbers/Strings
- [ ] Other: —

**Concrete Examples**:
- `applyInt()`, `applyOptional()`, `applyMax()` style utilities operating on builder text rather than fluent method chaining
- Parsers needing to know specific modifier application order, increasing coupling and cognitive load

### Business/Technical Justification
- [x] Developer velocity impact: Fluent, Zod-like API improves discoverability and reduces friction
- [x] Technical debt accumulation: Moves from procedural string mods to cohesive builder wrappers
- [x] Architecture: Aligns internal API with Zod chaining semantics for clearer mapping from JSON Schema
- [ ] Blocking new features
- [ ] Performance degradation
- [ ] Security vulnerability
- [ ] Causing frequent bugs

## Proposed Improvement

### Refactoring Pattern/Technique
**Primary Technique**: Introduce Fluent Interface + Extract Class; Replace Procedural Modifiers with Method Chaining

**High-Level Approach**:
Introduce Zod-like fluent wrappers around the builder’s source text. Example: `build.number()` returns a `NumberBuilder` wrapper exposing `.int()`, `.optional()`, `.max(n)`, etc., which apply the same transformations previously implemented by `applyInt()`, `applyOptional()`, `applyMax()`. Each wrapper encapsulates both the underlying source text and the modifier methods, producing identical final output as before. Parsers switch to using fluent builders rather than invoking `apply*` helpers directly. Unwrapping is explicit via `.done()` which returns the final code string, avoiding accidental coercion and improving testability.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-13
- Q: What is the unwrapping contract for fluent builders? → A: Use explicit `.done()` to return the final code string.

**Files Affected**:
- **Modified**:
  - src/ZodBuilder/modifiers.ts (adapt to fluent method exports and/or support functions)
  - src/ZodBuilder/number.ts (expose `NumberBuilder` with `.int()`, `.max()`, `.min()`, `.optional()`, etc.)
  - src/ZodBuilder/string.ts (expose `.min()`, `.max()`, `.regex()`, `.email()`, `.uuid()`, etc.)
  - src/ZodBuilder/object.ts, array.ts, boolean.ts, null.ts, enum.ts, const.ts (add corresponding fluent wrappers)
  - src/ZodBuilder/index.ts (export new fluent builder surface)
  - src/JsonSchema/jsonSchemaToZod.ts (use fluent builders when assembling output)
  - src/parsers/* (replace calls to `apply*` helpers with fluent chaining on returned builders)
  - src/index.ts and src/jsonSchemaToZod.ts (wire-up entrypoints as needed)
- **Created**:
  - src/ZodBuilder/fluent.ts (optional: shared base wrapper that holds source text and common chain logic)
- **Deleted**:
  - None (retain old helpers initially for safety, deprecate later if needed)
- **Moved**:
  - None initially

### Design Improvements
**Before**:
```
Parsers → applyInt/applyMax/applyOptional → mutate source text → return string
```

**After**:
```
Parsers → build.number() → NumberBuilder
NumberBuilder.int().optional().max(10) → returns final source text
Consistent Zod-like chaining surface across all types
```

## Target Metrics
*Goals to achieve - measurable success criteria*

### Code Quality Goals
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maintain or reduce (vs baseline)
- **Lines of Code**: Acceptable if slightly increased for clarity; aim to reduce duplication
- **Duplication**: Reduce by consolidating modifier logic into fluent wrappers
- **Function Length**: Prefer smaller, cohesive methods on wrappers
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or increase

### Performance Goals
- **Build Time**: Maintain (no regression)
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain (no regression)
- **Runtime Performance**: Maintain (no regression > 5%)
- **Memory Usage**: Maintain

### Success Threshold
**Minimum acceptable improvement**: Maintain identical external behavior and outputs; provide fluent Zod-like builder surface; reduce coupling between parsers and modifier helpers.

## Behavior Preservation Guarantee
*CRITICAL: Refactoring MUST NOT change external behavior*

### External Contracts Unchanged
- [x] CLI arguments unchanged
- [x] File formats unchanged (generated Zod code strings)
- [x] Function signatures for public entrypoints unchanged (or properly deprecated)

### Test Suite Validation
- [x] **All existing tests MUST pass WITHOUT modification**
- [x] If a test needs changing, verify it was testing implementation detail, not behavior
- [x] Do NOT weaken assertions to make tests pass

### Behavioral Snapshot
**Key behaviors to preserve**:
1. Given JSON Schema inputs, generated Zod output string remains identical
2. Modifier semantics: `.int()`, `.optional()`, `.max(n)` match prior `applyInt()`, `applyOptional()`, `applyMax()`
3. Order of chaining maintains same resulting output as previous logic

**Test**: Run before and after refactoring; outputs MUST be identical

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level Justification
**Why Medium Risk**:
Touches core builder surfaces and parser integration. Blast radius includes many parsers and type builders. However, behavior is deterministic and validated by existing tests.

### Potential Issues
- **Risk 1**: Subtle change in chain ordering could alter output
  - **Mitigation**: Keep wrapper methods delegating to existing logic; add focused tests that compare outputs
  - **Rollback**: Revert wrapper integration and restore procedural helpers

- **Risk 2**: Missing parity across types (e.g., number has `.int()` while others lack expected methods)
  - **Mitigation**: Implement wrappers iteratively with parity checks; use test suite coverage for each parser
  - **Rollback**: Gate new wrappers behind internal use until parity achieved

### Safety Measures
- [x] Incremental commits (can revert partially)
- [x] Peer review required
- [x] Staging validation (local test suite)
- [x] Rollback plan (git revert)

## Rollback Plan

### How to Undo
1. Revert commit range on `refactor/003-apply-fluent-paradigms`
2. Remove wrapper integrations from parsers and builders
3. Verify test suite returns to baseline outputs

### Rollback Triggers
Revert if any of these occur:
- [x] Test suite failure not attributable to implementation-detail changes
- [x] Output diff in generated Zod strings for covered schemas

### Recovery Time Objective
**RTO**: < 30 minutes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline (Before Refactoring)
1. Capture all baseline metrics (run `.specify/extensions/workflows/refactor/measure-metrics.sh --before`)
2. Create behavioral snapshot (document current outputs)
3. Ensure 100% test pass rate
4. Tag current state in git: `git tag pre-refactor-003 -m "Baseline before refactor-003"`

### Phase 2: Refactoring (Incremental)
1. Introduce base fluent wrapper (`fluent.ts`) with shared chaining utilities
2. Implement `build.number()` → `NumberBuilder` with `.int()`, `.optional()`, `.max()`, `.min()`, `.nonnegative()`, etc.
3. Migrate parsers to use fluent number builder; validate outputs
4. Repeat for string/object/array/boolean/null/enum/const builders with parity

**Principle**: Each step compiles and passes tests

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Run full test suite (MUST pass 100%)
2. Re-measure all metrics
3. Compare behavioral snapshot (MUST be identical)
4. Manual inspection of representative outputs

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. Code review focused on behavior preservation
2. Merge once stable and equivalent
